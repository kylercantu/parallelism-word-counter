Parallism-Word-Counter is a user-friendly GUI application designed to count words across multiple text files efficiently. Users can upload any number of text files and choose between two processing modes: sequential, where files are processed one at a time, or parallel, where each file is processed simultaneously using one thread per file. The output provides the total word count across all files and the total execution time. This program demonstrates the advantages of parallel processing in improving execution efficiency compared to sequential execution, highlighting how parallelism can significantly reduce processing time for large or numerous files.
